# Fingerprint Image Pre-processing & Classification
This project aims to implement a comprehensive system, in the form of a web-application, consisting of fingerprint image pre-processing methods and a classification model to categorize prints into five classes â€“ Arch, Tented Arch, Left Loop, Right Loop, and Whorl.

## Pre-processing Methods
* Adaptive Histogram Equalization
* Gabor Filtering
* Threshold Binarization
* Thinning
* Inpainting
* Principal Component Analysis

## Classification Methods
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Random Forest (RF)
* XGBoost (XGB)
* Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16)
